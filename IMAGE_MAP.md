# Image map for spreads

This file documents which image is assigned to each spread according to the `reglas.md` requirement that the magazine be composed of spreads (one photo = two pages).

Mapping (spread -> image):

- spread-1: img/hero/cedahause-hero.png
- spread-2: img/hero/ciane-hero.jpg
- spread-3: img/hero/gadehause-hero.jpg
- spread-4: img/hero/jomahause-hero.jpg
- spread-5: img/hero/magahause-hero.jpg
- spread-6: img/hero/markhause-hero.jpg
- spread-7: img/hero/scohause-hero.jpg
- spread-8: img/hero/usahause-hero.jpg
- spread-9: img/hero/vidahause-hero.jpg

Notes:
- Left page (`spread-N-left`) shows the LEFT half of the image (background-position: left center).
- Right page (`spread-N-right`) shows the RIGHT half of the image (background-position: right center).
- Add new images by adding the two page elements and mapping them here; then update `style.css` selectors accordingly.
